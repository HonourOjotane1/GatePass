# GatePass

**GatePass** is a modern digital platform for managing event guest lists, RSVPs, and access control in real-time.

## ðŸ”‘ What It Does

GatePass replaces outdated guest list systems like spreadsheets, notepads, and printed lists with a secure, fast, and reliable digital system. It streamlines event access by allowing guests to RSVP online, receive a unique ID or QR code, and get checked in instantly at the event venue.

## âœ¨ Key Features (Planned)

- Event creation and guest list upload
- Secure RSVP with unique ID/QR generation
- Real-time check-in by access control personnel
- Guest search by name, QR code or ID
- Admin dashboard for live stats and attendance tracking
- Role tagging (VIP, Media, Staff, etc.)
- Offline check-in support (future)
- AI integration for guest behavior prediction and facial recognition (future)

## ðŸš€ MVP Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React or Flutter
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI /
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth
- **Hosting**: Firebase / Vercel / AWS
- **QR Code**: qrcode library (or python-qrcode)
