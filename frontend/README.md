# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# GatePass

**GatePass** is a modern digital platform for managing event guest lists, RSVPs, and access control in real-time.

## ðŸ”‘ What It Does

GatePass replaces outdated guest list systems like spreadsheets, notepads, and printed lists with a secure, fast, and reliable digital system. It streamlines event access by allowing guests to RSVP online, receive a unique ID or QR code, and get checked in instantly at the event venue.

## âœ¨ Key Features (Planned)

- Event creation and guest list upload
- Secure RSVP with unique ID/QR generation
- Real-time check-in by access control personnel
- Guest search by name, QR code or ID
- Admin dashboard for live stats and attendance tracking
- Role tagging (VIP, Media, Staff, etc.)
- Offline check-in support (future)
- AI integration for guest behavior prediction and facial recognition (future)

## ðŸš€ MVP Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React or Flutter
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI /
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth
- **Hosting**: Firebase / Vercel / AWS
- **QR Code**: qrcode library (or python-qrcode)

## ðŸ‘· Project Status

This project is currently in the planning and early development phase. As I make progress, I'll keep this README updated with features, structure, deployment instructions, and contributions.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Improve guest experience at private and corporate events
- Provide organizers with a fast, modern alternative to traditional RSVP methods
- Increase event security and professionalism
